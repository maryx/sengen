done your taxes after doing mine
said that you liked my hat
given me two presents in December even though my birthday is on Christmas
brought me flours instead of flowers
gotten me English muffins on Valentine's day

gotten me some nuts and gum - together at last!
played "Wonderwall" for me on your spankin\' new guitar from Amazon
solved P = NP by now
